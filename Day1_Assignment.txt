Important Instruction

1. Please write your own code for each problem. Please do not copy from any sources. It may leads to deduction in your final grade. For any clarification, Please contact to your mentor.
2. Take all possible input from user within your code.
3. Please maintain indentation in your code.
4. Please write your comment for your approach/solution within the code. 
5. All questions are compulsory. 
6. You have to write pseudo code for each problem. No need to write java code. 
7. Please do not use any inbuilt function or library for any question. 

Questions. 

1) Please print the sum of all even numbers and sum of all odd numbers less than or equal to a given number N. Here you need to take input number N from the user. 
Sample input - N = 5
sample output - even sum => 2 + 4 = 6
		odd sum => 1+3+5 = 9



2) Please check if a given number N is prime or not?
Sample input - N = 5
sample output - "yes, 5 is a prime number."



3) You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. 
There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the list.
 Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.
Sample Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8}
Sample Output: 5
Explanation: The missing number from 1 to 8 is 5



4) Write a pseudo code that reverse a string. Take input string from user. 
Please think of an optimized approach. (you can not use any inbuilt function or library)

Sample input - "bitLabs"
Sample output - "sbaLtib"



5)Write a pseudo code to search an element in a given array and return it's index position. your code should return "Not Found" message if element is not found.  
Take all input array elements from user. 

Sample input - array = [1,4,3,6,8,2]
		key = 2

Sample output = 5 ( index position of 2 is 5)




6) Please write an optimized approach to search an element in a given array if the given array is sorted. Your pseudo code should return "Not Found" message if element is not found.  
Take all input array elements from user. 
Sample input - array = [1,2,3,6,8,9]
		key = 2

Sample output = 1 ( index position of 2 is 1)




7) Write a pseudo code to search lowest and secound lowest number in an array. Take all input array elements from user.
Sample input - array = [1,4,3,6,2,9]

Sample output-	lowest element = 1
		secound lowest = 2



8) Write a pseudo code to do basic arithmatic calculations, Addition/ substraction/ Multiplication/ Division. Your code should take two numbers and an operator from user to get the output. 
Sample input - first number - 4
		secound number - 8
		operator = +

Sample output-	12 => (4+8)

code:  bouble a,b,w,x,y,z;
        a=5;
	b=2;
	w=a+b;
	x=a-b;
	y=a*b;
	z=a/b;
	system.out.println("w");
	system.out.println("x");
        system.out.println("y");
	system.out.println("z");
      
    



9) Given an array of integers. All numbers occur twice except one number which occurs once. Please take all input array elements from user and write an optimized approach. 
Input:  array - [7, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4]
Output: 7 



10) Write a pseudo code to convert a decimal to it's binary form. Please Do NOT use any built-in fuction or library. Take number from user only. 
Sample input - N = 5

Sample output- 101



11). Write a pseudo code to compute the volume of a sphere. Use the formula: V = (4/3) *pi*r3 where pi is equal to 3.1416 approximately. The r is the radius of sphere.  Display the result.

12). Write a pseudo code the converts the input Celsius degree into its equivalent Fahrenheit degree. Use the formula: F = (9/5) *C+32.

13). Write a pseudo code that converts the input dollar to its peso exchange rate equivalent.  Assume that the present exchange rate is 51.50 pesos against the dollar. Then display the peso equivalent exchange rate.

14) Write a pseudo code that converts an input inch(es) into its equivalent centimeters. Take note that one inch is equivalent to 2.54cms.

15) Write a pseudo code that exchanges the value of two variables: x and y.  The output must be: the value of variable y will become the value of variable x, and vice versa.

16) Design a pseudo code to find the circumference of a circle. Use the formula: C=2πr, where π is approximately equivalent 3.1416.

17) Write a pseudo code for Swapping of 2 variables without using temporary (or 3rd variable).

18) Draw a flowchart to log in to your bitLabs LMS account.
